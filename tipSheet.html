    <b><h2> Paper-based Preservation Tips </b></h2>
    <p> Preserving paper-based materials is important because these items first it is one of the oldest and most widely used ways of recording information. Some paper-based materials date back to 100 BCE. Paper-based materials are usually defined as materials composed of compressed cellulosic resource and with the content written in ink (usually carbon based). </p>

        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Loose/unbound documents and/or manuscripts should be thoughtfully handled when
copying or scanning. These items can be extremely brittle when they are greatly aged
and to prevent damage from tearing/crumbling/etc.. (Page-turners should be used when
handling). </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Control your storage environment and handling environments and avoid ultraviolet (UV)
light exposure. These can be unsafe environments for not only paper based
objects but other similar material items as well. Many storage/special collections areas
may not have any windows so this may not be an issue for storage but care should be
taken when handling in areas outside of storage for viewing purposes. UV filtering glass
can be used for displaying original documents. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Controlling humidity levels for storage, ideally conditions for storage areas will have
a relative humidity level of 30-60 percent. This also relates to controlling temperature
levels for storage, ideally conditions for storage areas will be between 35 degrees
fahrenheit and 65 degrees fahrenheit.

      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Paper-based materials should also be properly stored in areas with adequate air
quality; meaning that the spaces are free from volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
dust, and pollution. </p>

        <p> Using proper preventative pest control measures for storage areas is highly recommended as many insects, mold spores, and small animals
can use paper-based material for nesting or consumption. Locating things such as trash cans away from storage areas is one measure. </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Refrain from using paper clips, tape, and staples with paper-based objects as these
items can introduce contaminants that will ruin the material over time. </p>

  <b><h2> Photograph Preservation Tips </b></h2>
  <p> Photographs are the most iconic mediums to record cultures, past events, and many other things we in society find important to remember. These materials date back to the mid 1800's. </p>
<br />
    <section class="sub-section">
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> When storing photographic materials be sure to keep them in areas with low relative
humidity levels (50%) and temperatures never above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
 </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> When storing photo-based materials in “cold” or “frozen” storage i.e. anything below
50 degrees fahrenheit, proper packing techniques should be utilized such as double
sealing the photos in polyethylene zip bags or wrapping with polypropylene sealing tape
because of the likelihood of increased humidity levels in such conditions. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Follow the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommended
guidelines, such as the recommendation to use buffered storage (compartmentalized)
materials for all photographs. </p>

      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Storing photographs be mindful not to store larger dimensioned photos on top of
smaller dimensioned photos, this can result in the larger photos becoming distorted over
time due to sagging on the edges that are not supported. </p>

  <b><h2> Recorded (Audio) Format Preservation Tips </b></h2>
  <p> Preserving with sound materials is important because it will allow us in the present as well as those in the future to better conceive the cultural heritage of societies in the past. Sound materials are also one of the most visceral ways to connect to the past.  </p>

        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Controlling temperature is one way to prolong the inevitable deterioration of magnetic media, to reduce the speed of chemical reactions like hydrolysis (compact cassettes and open-reel audio tape) should be stored in temperatures not to exceed above 75°F to avoid the tape film from tightening and not exceed below 32°F as this can cause deformation such as shrinking.  </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> When storing magnetic media the orientation should be vertical on the edges, not flat. The magnetic tape wrapped around the reels inside can become deformed if stored improperly.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> To avoid irreparable damage to the surface of vinyl records it is advised to properly clean the recording medium. Such methods include an ultrasonic cleaner. Doing so can prevent creating indents during future playback which can result in a distorted sound of the original recording.  </p>

      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Considering that sound materials are essentially machine readable documents, it is highly advisable to acquire spare parts or machines used to access the content/recordings.  </p>

  <b><h2> Moving Image (Visual/Video) Preservation Tips </b></h2>
  <p> Preserving moving images is important because it is one of the most objective ways to analyse various cultures of the past. Unlike other historic recordings, video allows the least amount of (fill in the blank) interpretation. </p>
<br />
    <section class="sub-section">
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Some motion picture reels used nitrate film which is ignitable (these items emit gases that can be harmful), strict safety precautions should be taken if a collection contains these moving image films ie.. specialized storage. These materials date from 1891-1951. </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> When storing 8mm, 16mm, and 35mm film the ideal temperature range is about 40°F with a relative humidity of about 35% and preferably in a well-ventilated area. </p>

      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> When storing film reels it is important to consider adequate shelving and proper building structure integrity, as the total weight can be much higher than that of normal paper-based collections.  </p>

      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> It is advisable to store film reels in dark rooms, too much light exposure could potentially damage the still images. Film cans are also recommended for storing film reels, such as plastic or metal film cans.   </p>

        <p><b> *The following are three suggestions that an institution should consider before accepting audiovisual (A/V) material into their collection </p></b>
    <br />
    <p> 1 - Institutions might want to consider the inevitable degradation of these materials (many of these analog optical and analog audio formats are plastic based ie.. synthetic polymers). Although some can last over a hundred years (if stored and handled properly) they will overtime degrade naturally and become unusable. </p>
    <p> 2 - Institutions might want to consider the overall scope of dealing with an A/V collection which can include a very broad range of mediums each with its own production and subsequent obsolescent timeline and the overall time that will need to be allocated to conserve, preserve, and restore such collections. </p>
    <p> 3 - Institutions have finite space, when deciding to add or expand any collection including A/V collections be aware of all of the additional equipment (or systems) as well as expense that will be needed for maintenance, patron access, and cleaning.  </p>
    <br />

      <b><h2> Digitized Objects </b></h2>
  <p> Why digitizing items is important....Put Paragraph Here. </p>
<br />
    <section class="sub-section">
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> When appending a digital object file of any sort to a collection, it is critical to have or make a working copy that is not the original source and when working with an unknown file format to interact with it in an isolated environment (ideally a virtual machine) as a security precaution as not to corrupt other data within the collection. Some file formats could contain executable programs that can possibly contain malicious code within them. </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Be aware of the various file formats available, some may be proprietary and may require proprietary software to be accessible. Buying additional subscription based software for digital items can potentially become costly, putting additional strain on smaller institutions. Consider open-source or free-ware formats when digitizing objects. At the end of the day all we are storing here are 1’s and 0’s (binary code). All the programs do is interpret these numbers based on the file format and today many options exist that are more than adequate for a library's purpose of preserving this information. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> It is advisable to regularly (perhaps annually) run an audit to certify the integrity of each digital collection. Creating a checksum for individual collections which is a numerical value of the actual number of bytes/blocks that the collection is composed of will help to monitor if data has become corrupt overtime. However it should be noted that this doesn’t provide/isn’t the same as a certificate of authenticity if transferring the collection over the internet. Additional asymmetric encryption measures should be taken that include signatures (public-private keys) for integrity and authentication of the data. </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Planning for a digital collection is key, creating correct metadata for content that is relevant will save future confusion (or headache) as these collections can become quite a bit more extensive over time usually. Another consideration is thoroughly understanding the associated copyright licensing terms for materials. </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="sub-section">
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> Certain digital storage media such as Linear Tape Open (LTO), Digital Audio Tape (DAT), Zip discs, Magnetic Tapes, and Floppy Discs (8-inch, 5-inch, and 3 ½-inch) should be accessioned into the digital collection (or digitized) as soon as possible using digital forensic tools because none of these media types are stable for long term preservation.  </p>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="square">
        <a href= "./tip.jpeg"><img src="./Images/tip.png"></a>
        <p> When handling carrier media, use extra caution with the discs (LTO, DAT, Magnetic tapes, and floppy drives/discs). Try to refrain from sudden shocks/violent vibrations, try avoiding significant and sudden temperature changes when moving from one environment to another, and finally avoid discharging static buildup when touching these types of materials.  </p>
